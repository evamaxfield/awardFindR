To examine the level of economic empowerment of women before and after customary land ownership.

It critically explores the idea of South Africa as a constitutional democracy and how free speech legislation at once promotes and inhibits access to information. I employ a comparative political science analysis that discusses democracy as a system of intellectual requirements that need to be fulfilled in order to function in a network society. \\nMy research traces the study of digital cultures and suggests a reallocation of power from government back to citizens in the nexus between the physical and digital space of protest. Furthermore, I interrogate whether there is a new socio-political framework that arises from this and whether this framework bases itself on the political structure of western democracy or whether South Africa has shifted into an autocratic state.\\n I explore the relationship between digital activism as a form of protest against political elites who use classification of information to conduct corrupt activities. I achieve this through a critical exploration of media reports, South African legislation on communicative freedom and free speech activist groups such as The Right 2 Know Campaign and the SOS Coalition.\",\"award_title\":\"\",\"award_institution\":\"University of Cape Town\",\"award_department\":\"\",\"image_url\":\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/ssrc-cdn1/crmuploads/contact/brevis-chad-c.jpg\",\"related_competitions\":\"Next Generation Social Sciences in Africa: Doctoral Dissertation Proposal Fellowship\",\"fellow_topics\":\"\",\"authors\":null,\"primary_author\":null,\"publish_date\":null,\"publisher\":null,\"s3azure_image_url\":\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/ssrc-cdn1/crmuploads/contact/brevis-chad-c.jpg\",\"s3azure_pdf_url\":null,\"type\":null,\"post_year\":2021,\"content\":\"Chad Brevis is a PhD student in the Centre for Film & Media Studies at the University of Cape Town specializing in socio-political disapprobation to freedom of speech and the rise of online ‘hacktivism’ culture in a digital democracy.

To attain this, sustainable agriculture is advocated as a golden solution. Since its independence in 1961, Tanzania has committed to agriculture for the same rationale. However, this strategy has proved less effective to the ethnic minorities. Indeed, food insecurity has continued to cause peace instability to such communities. The Hadzabe community is a case in point. The government efforts have proved futile to the community. This raises an important research question, \\\"Why the government's food security interventions brought about unfavourable outcomes for both the policymakers and the communities?\\\" This study sets out to explain the reasons for the failure of government's food security interventions in the Hadzabe community. The study will employ a case-study research design.

This study seeks to examine those factors that could help explain the current political stalemate and instability from three interrelated perspectives. \\nFirst, ethnicity and federal restructuring– unlike other federations, Ethiopia expressly empowers ethnicity. In other words, ethnicity is constitutionalised as the chief instrument of state organization in the federal and regional constitutions. Indeed, self-governance and autonomy in the Ethiopian federal system are premised on the matching of ethnic and politico- administrative boundaries. We contend in this study that rigorous ethnicisation of territory contributed to inter-ethnic tensions and conflicts. \\nSecond, federalism and political pluralism – the study examines how the narrowing of political space continues to affect federalism's ability to emerge as a sustainable instrument of conflict management. Indeed, since the controversial 2005 elections, the ruling party undertook a series of legislative measures that greatly curtailed political pluralism in the country. Consequently, there is now no representation of opposition parties in the federal and regional parliaments. Nor are there vibrant civil society and media in the country. The lack of open and peaceful platform for political protestation and contestation, we contend in this study, led to violent protests. \\nThird, reforming Ethiopia's federalism – the study contends that all federations are 'works in progress' and need to adjust themselves from time to time in order to respond to their legal and institutional deficits and in response to new challenges. In light of this, the study is going to consider legal/constitutional and institutional reforms that would be required to put the Ethiopian federal system on a sustainable trajectory.\",\"award_title\":\"\",\"award_institution\":\"Addis Ababa University\",\"award_department\":\"Department of Political Science and International Relations\",\"image_url\":\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/ssrc-cdn1/crmuploads/contact/%7B3EC4DC6B-97F4-E711-80CA-005056AB0BD9%7D.jpg\",\"related_competitions\":\"African Peacebuilding Network: Individual Research Fellowships\",\"fellow_topics\":\"\",\"authors\":null,\"primary_author\":null,\"publish_date\":null,\"publisher\":null,\"s3azure_image_url\":\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/ssrc-cdn1/crmuploads/contact/%7B3EC4DC6B-97F4-E711-80CA-005056AB0BD9%7D.jpg\",\"s3azure_pdf_url\":null,\"type\":null,\"post_year\":2018,\"content\":\"Dr. Asnake Kefale received his PhD in Political Science from the University of Leiden in the Netherlands.

Specifically, this study focuses on the content of Ugandan Muslim television; Salaam TV and the four Muslim radio stations (i.e. Bilal FM, Voice of Africa FM, Pearl FM, and IUIU FM), and the meaning audiences construct in relation to national unity. Three strategic questions guide this study; 1) What informs the framing and packaging of Muslim Radio and Television Stations in Uganda? 2) How do Muslim Radio and Television Stations deal with social religious discourse prevailing in Uganda? 3) What kind of meaning audiences construct from broadcasted content by Ugandan Muslim radio and television stations? The study intends first to bridge the academic gap as for as the interdisciplinary study of religion and media is concerned in East Africa and Uganda, but most importantly, to examine Muslim electronic media and their role in shaping Muslim identity along religious lines.

Furthermore, I interrogate whether there is a new socio-political framework that arises from this and whether this framework bases itself on the political structure of western democracy or whether South Africa has shifted into an autocratic state.\\n I explore the relationship between digital activism as a form of protest against political elites who use classification of information to conduct corrupt activities.

To attain this, sustainable agriculture is advocated as a golden solution. Since its independence in 1961, Tanzania has committed to agriculture for the same rationale. However, this strategy has proved less effective to the ethnic minorities. Indeed, food insecurity has continued to cause peace instability to such communities. The Hadzabe community is a case in point. The government efforts have proved futile to the community. This raises an important research question, \\\"Why the government's food security interventions brought about unfavourable outcomes for both the policymakers and the communities?\\\" This study sets out to explain the reasons for the failure of government's food security interventions in the Hadzabe community. The study will employ a case-study research design.

This study seeks to examine those factors that could help explain the current political stalemate and instability from three interrelated perspectives. \\nFirst, ethnicity and federal restructuring– unlike other federations, Ethiopia expressly empowers ethnicity. In other words, ethnicity is constitutionalised as the chief instrument of state organization in the federal and regional constitutions. Indeed, self-governance and autonomy in the Ethiopian federal system are premised on the matching of ethnic and politico- administrative boundaries. We contend in this study that rigorous ethnicisation of territory contributed to inter-ethnic tensions and conflicts. \\nSecond, federalism and political pluralism – the study examines how the narrowing of political space continues to affect federalism's ability to emerge as a sustainable instrument of conflict management. Indeed, since the controversial 2005 elections, the ruling party undertook a series of legislative measures that greatly curtailed political pluralism in the country. Consequently, there is now no representation of opposition parties in the federal and regional parliaments. Nor are there vibrant civil society and media in the country. The lack of open and peaceful platform for political protestation and contestation, we contend in this study, led to violent protests. \\nThird, reforming Ethiopia's federalism – the study contends that all federations are 'works in progress' and need to adjust themselves from time to time in order to respond to their legal and institutional deficits and in response to new challenges. In light of this, the study is going to consider legal/constitutional and institutional reforms that would be required to put the Ethiopian federal system on a sustainable trajectory.\",\"award_title\":\"\",\"award_institution\":\"Addis Ababa University\",\"award_department\":\"Department of Political Science and International Relations\",\"image_url\":\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/ssrc-cdn1/crmuploads/contact/%7B3EC4DC6B-97F4-E711-80CA-005056AB0BD9%7D.jpg\",\"related_competitions\":\"African Peacebuilding Network: Individual Research Fellowships\",\"fellow_topics\":\"\",\"authors\":null,\"primary_author\":null,\"publish_date\":null,\"publisher\":null,\"s3azure_image_url\":\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/ssrc-cdn1/crmuploads/contact/%7B3EC4DC6B-97F4-E711-80CA-005056AB0BD9%7D.jpg\",\"s3azure_pdf_url\":null,\"type\":null,\"post_year\":2018,\"content\":\"Dr. Asnake Kefale received his PhD in Political Science from the University of Leiden in the Netherlands.

Their everyday living experiences and narratives are symptomatic of life devoid of security, characteristically gendered and seemingly constrained in terms of social and physical space and practices. I employ the Feminist Posthuman Approach as my analytical framework to espouse the visibly gendered outlook characterizing the current realities and the subsequent epistemological discourse of peace and security in practice and theory as influenced by the 'intra-actions'  of humans and objects respectively. My study seeks to explore this epistemological trajectory through the use of novel techniques of analysis in the form of a discursive-materialist analysis of the human-object entanglement, where landmines as objects possess a coercive effect in reconfiguring the everyday experiences and security of the people in Mukumbura in a post-conflict context. This dimension inclines to the Posthumanism or new materialities perspective which engender the object as unit of analysis/actor in human security and peace discourse in post-conflict contexts relative to the traditional realist notion of security-insecurity as a function of humans alone.

However, most\\nstudies of conflict in the region have only focused on social, economic,\\npolitical, religious and environmental factors, ignoring salient\\nhistoriographical/textual and discursive roots and processes of the\\nphenomenon. This project interrogates how\\nthe extra-textual meaning-assigning agency of historiography is\\nmanufactured and weaponized in conflict situations. As monster-making\\ntechnology, these narratives originally popularized by journalists gradually\\nsneaked into the academia, creating a dissident community of discourse –\\nacademic authors, activists, priests and publishers who together constructed\\na popular cultural resentment against the Hausa-Fulani Muslims. The\\nconsumers of these narratives are constantly reminded of the historical\\ninjuries of the 19th jihad wars in Hausa land and mobilized along the most\\ndreaded discursive idioms – \\\"Kaduna Mafia: the Killer Squad\\\", \\\"northern\\nminorities, why we fight them\\\", \\\"Hausa-Fulani violence\\\", and \\\"pastoral\\njihadism\\\", which featured regularly in both academic and popular discourse.\\nBetween 1980 and 2016 more than 100 violent communal clashes – in which\\nthousands of people including women and children lost their lives – were\\nreported in the volatile Middle Belt areas of Jos, Benue and Southern Kaduna.\\nTo what extent do these historical discourses function as\\nincentive to violent clashes? Located within critical work that is attuned to the salience of knowledge-conflict nexus, the project seeks to demonstrate how historical narratives, animated by rumours and conspiracy theories, acquired functional discursive properties and social meaning. Preliminary reading of the conflicts suggests deep-seated intersection between historiography, victimhood, vengeance and violence.\",\"award_title\":\"\",\"award_institution\":\"Bayero University Kano\",\"award_department\":\"Department of History\",\"image_url\":\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/ssrc-cdn1/crmuploads/contact/%7BC04E8D00-7DAE-E611-80C2-005056AB0BD9%7D.jpg\",\"related_competitions\":\"African Peacebuilding Network: Individual Research Fellowships\",\"fellow_topics\":\"\",\"authors\":null,\"primary_author\":null,\"publish_date\":null,\"publisher\":null,\"s3azure_image_url\":\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/ssrc-cdn1/crmuploads/contact/%7BC04E8D00-7DAE-E611-80C2-005056AB0BD9%7D.jpg\",\"s3azure_pdf_url\":null,\"type\":null,\"post_year\":2021,\"content\":\"Dr. Samaila Suleiman is a lecturer in History at Bayero University, Kano.

All countries face major challenges to ensure preparedness in health and social systems. Japan is the most advanced aging society in the world (28 % of the aging rate), with great pressure on national finance, e.g., an increase of $6.6 million primarily targeting the older population for the 2019 budget. Japan is shifting from a hospital-base to home-base health care delivery to prepare for an estimated 1.6 million deaths/yr. from 2035. Such rapid demographic change threatens individuals, communities, society, and the country. The US (15 % of aging rate) will have 78 million people aged over 65, exceeding the number of children. Hospices (over 6,100) outnumbered hospitals (5,723). Medicare Part A covers end-of-life care is estimated to be depleted by 2030. \\n\\nWhat is Unknown: Justice in end-of-life is little studied in general. The end-of-life care experts' experiences with dying patients were not well aggregated. \\n\\nPurpose of the Research: I will examine how justice (through a bioethics and human rights-based approach) may improve 'quality of life' and 'quality of death/dying' in end-of-life care by exploring achievements and challenges from a view of public policy. \\n\\nResearch Questions: (a) How do bioethics, human rights, and evidence-based medicine effect end-of-life care? (b) What are the situations of the quality of life and the quality of death/dying in end-of-life care? (c) How does the WHO's definition of 'health' fit to the changing demographics/societies? (d) What are the implications for improving 'quality of life' and the 'quality of death/dying' in end-of-life care in the aging societies? \\n\\nMethods: (a) Qualitative research, a powerful instrument for little studied subjects, will be the central analytical methodology for this proposed research. For data collection, analysis, and developing a theory, I will employ grounded theory, established by scholars who studied processes and situations of death/dying, which is used in health care fields. I will target interviews with one hundred end-of-life experts in the primary countries (Japan and the US) and other related countries (the UK and South Korea). I will perform open coding, axial coding, and theoretical coding. Theoretical sampling will be performed to judge a theoretical saturation (where no more new codes are being formed). NVivo will be used as a supporting instrument. (b) Quantitative research (typology and taxonomy methods) on quantifiable data will be used to fortify the analysis and interpretation of the qualitative research. (c) Content analysis will also be performed by qualitative and/or quantitative methodologies by contrasting my research contents.\\n\\nThe Value of the Research: A part of the proposed project will be conducted while serving as a coauthor of the Lancet Commission (2018-2019 scheduled). A synthesis of my analysis on end-of-life care, focusing on better life and a better death (with the Abe Fellowship Program and with the Lancet international project) will address the global threats of social and fiscal sustainability in aging societies. It will also showcase the important elements of interdisciplinary team-approaches, community/regional collaborations, and multi-sector partnerships.\",\"award_title\":\"Visiting Researcher\",\"award_institution\":\"Georgetown University\",\"award_department\":\"Kennedy Institute of  Ethics\",\"image_url\":\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/ssrc-cdn1/crmuploads/contact/sase-eriko.jpg\",\"related_competitions\":\"Abe Fellowship\",\"fellow_topics\":\"\",\"authors\":null,\"primary_author\":null,\"publish_date\":null,\"publisher\":null,\"s3azure_image_url\":\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/ssrc-cdn1/crmuploads/contact/sase-eriko.jpg\",\"s3azure_pdf_url\":null,\"type\":null,\"post_year\":2018,\"content\":\"Eriko Sase is an award winning scholar in Health Science.
