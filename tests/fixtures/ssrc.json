Their everyday living experiences and narratives are symptomatic of life devoid of security, characteristically gendered and seemingly constrained in terms of social and physical space and practices. I employ the Feminist Posthuman Approach as my analytical framework to espouse the visibly gendered outlook characterizing the current realities and the subsequent epistemological discourse of peace and security in practice and theory as influenced by the 'intra-actions'  of humans and objects respectively. My study seeks to explore this epistemological trajectory through the use of novel techniques of analysis in the form of a discursive-materialist analysis of the human-object entanglement, where landmines as objects possess a coercive effect in reconfiguring the everyday experiences and security of the people in Mukumbura in a post-conflict context. This dimension inclines to the Posthumanism or new materialities perspective which engender the object as unit of analysis/actor in human security and peace discourse in post-conflict contexts relative to the traditional realist notion of security-insecurity as a function of humans alone. I will insure the validity of my findings through use of more than one data collection tool. I will also probe further for clarity from my respondents.\",\"award_title\":\"\",\"award_institution\":\"University of the Free State\",\"award_department\":\"Sociology and Social Anthropology\",\"image_url\":\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/ssrc-cdn1/crmuploads/contact/tagarirofa-jacob.jpg\",\"related_competitions\":\"Next Generation Social Sciences in Africa: Doctoral Dissertation Proposal Fellowship\",\"fellow_topics\":\"\",\"authors\":null,\"primary_author\":null,\"publish_date\":null,\"publisher\":null,\"s3azure_image_url\":\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/ssrc-cdn1/crmuploads/contact/tagarirofa-jacob.jpg\",\"s3azure_pdf_url\":null,\"type\":null,\"post_year\":2020,\"content\":\"Jacob Tagarirofa is a socio-cultural anthropologist who is interested in peace, conflict, and gender in post-war communities.

However, most\\nstudies of conflict in the region have only focused on social, economic,\\npolitical, religious and environmental factors, ignoring salient\\nhistoriographical/textual and discursive roots and processes of the\\nphenomenon. This project interrogates how\\nthe extra-textual meaning-assigning agency of historiography is\\nmanufactured and weaponized in conflict situations. As monster-making\\ntechnology, these narratives originally popularized by journalists gradually\\nsneaked into the academia, creating a dissident community of discourse –\\nacademic authors, activists, priests and publishers who together constructed\\na popular cultural resentment against the Hausa-Fulani Muslims. The\\nconsumers of these narratives are constantly reminded of the historical\\ninjuries of the 19th jihad wars in Hausa land and mobilized along the most\\ndreaded discursive idioms – \\\"Kaduna Mafia: the Killer Squad\\\", \\\"northern\\nminorities, why we fight them\\\", \\\"Hausa-Fulani violence\\\", and \\\"pastoral\\njihadism\\\", which featured regularly in both academic and popular discourse.\\nBetween 1980 and 2016 more than 100 violent communal clashes – in which\\nthousands of people including women and children lost their lives – were\\nreported in the volatile Middle Belt areas of Jos, Benue and Southern Kaduna.\\nTo what extent do these historical discourses function as\\nincentive to violent clashes? Located within critical work that is attuned to the salience of knowledge-conflict nexus, the project seeks to demonstrate how historical narratives, animated by rumours and conspiracy theories, acquired functional discursive properties and social meaning. Preliminary reading of the conflicts suggests deep-seated intersection between historiography, victimhood, vengeance and violence.\",\"award_title\":\"\",\"award_institution\":\"Bayero University Kano\",\"award_department\":\"Department of History\",\"image_url\":\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/ssrc-cdn1/crmuploads/contact/%7BC04E8D00-7DAE-E611-80C2-005056AB0BD9%7D.jpg\",\"related_competitions\":\"African Peacebuilding Network: Individual Research Fellowships\",\"fellow_topics\":\"\",\"authors\":null,\"primary_author\":null,\"publish_date\":null,\"publisher\":null,\"s3azure_image_url\":\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/ssrc-cdn1/crmuploads/contact/%7BC04E8D00-7DAE-E611-80C2-005056AB0BD9%7D.jpg\",\"s3azure_pdf_url\":null,\"type\":null,\"post_year\":2021,\"content\":\"Dr. Samaila Suleiman is a lecturer in History at Bayero University, Kano.

All countries face major challenges to ensure preparedness in health and social systems. Japan is the most advanced aging society in the world (28 % of the aging rate), with great pressure on national finance, e.g., an increase of $6.6 million primarily targeting the older population for the 2019 budget. Japan is shifting from a hospital-base to home-base health care delivery to prepare for an estimated 1.6 million deaths/yr. from 2035. Such rapid demographic change threatens individuals, communities, society, and the country. The US (15 % of aging rate) will have 78 million people aged over 65, exceeding the number of children. Hospices (over 6,100) outnumbered hospitals (5,723). Medicare Part A covers end-of-life care is estimated to be depleted by 2030. \\n\\nWhat is Unknown: Justice in end-of-life is little studied in general. The end-of-life care experts' experiences with dying patients were not well aggregated. \\n\\nPurpose of the Research: I will examine how justice (through a bioethics and human rights-based approach) may improve 'quality of life' and 'quality of death/dying' in end-of-life care by exploring achievements and challenges from a view of public policy. \\n\\nResearch Questions: (a) How do bioethics, human rights, and evidence-based medicine effect end-of-life care? (b) What are the situations of the quality of life and the quality of death/dying in end-of-life care? (c) How does the WHO's definition of 'health' fit to the changing demographics/societies? (d) What are the implications for improving 'quality of life' and the 'quality of death/dying' in end-of-life care in the aging societies? \\n\\nMethods: (a) Qualitative research, a powerful instrument for little studied subjects, will be the central analytical methodology for this proposed research. For data collection, analysis, and developing a theory, I will employ grounded theory, established by scholars who studied processes and situations of death/dying, which is used in health care fields. I will target interviews with one hundred end-of-life experts in the primary countries (Japan and the US) and other related countries (the UK and South Korea). I will perform open coding, axial coding, and theoretical coding. Theoretical sampling will be performed to judge a theoretical saturation (where no more new codes are being formed). NVivo will be used as a supporting instrument. (b) Quantitative research (typology and taxonomy methods) on quantifiable data will be used to fortify the analysis and interpretation of the qualitative research. (c) Content analysis will also be performed by qualitative and/or quantitative methodologies by contrasting my research contents.\\n\\nThe Value of the Research: A part of the proposed project will be conducted while serving as a coauthor of the Lancet Commission (2018-2019 scheduled). A synthesis of my analysis on end-of-life care, focusing on better life and a better death (with the Abe Fellowship Program and with the Lancet international project) will address the global threats of social and fiscal sustainability in aging societies.

Their everyday living experiences and narratives are symptomatic of life devoid of security, characteristically gendered and seemingly constrained in terms of social and physical space and practices. I employ the Feminist Posthuman Approach as my analytical framework to espouse the visibly gendered outlook characterizing the current realities and the subsequent epistemological discourse of peace and security in practice and theory as influenced by the 'intra-actions'  of humans and objects respectively. My study seeks to explore this epistemological trajectory through the use of novel techniques of analysis in the form of a discursive-materialist analysis of the human-object entanglement, where landmines as objects possess a coercive effect in reconfiguring the everyday experiences and security of the people in Mukumbura in a post-conflict context. This dimension inclines to the Posthumanism or new materialities perspective which engender the object as unit of analysis/actor in human security and peace discourse in post-conflict contexts relative to the traditional realist notion of security-insecurity as a function of humans alone. I will insure the validity of my findings through use of more than one data collection tool.

However, most\\nstudies of conflict in the region have only focused on social, economic,\\npolitical, religious and environmental factors, ignoring salient\\nhistoriographical/textual and discursive roots and processes of the\\nphenomenon. This project interrogates how\\nthe extra-textual meaning-assigning agency of historiography is\\nmanufactured and weaponized in conflict situations. As monster-making\\ntechnology, these narratives originally popularized by journalists gradually\\nsneaked into the academia, creating a dissident community of discourse –\\nacademic authors, activists, priests and publishers who together constructed\\na popular cultural resentment against the Hausa-Fulani Muslims. The\\nconsumers of these narratives are constantly reminded of the historical\\ninjuries of the 19th jihad wars in Hausa land and mobilized along the most\\ndreaded discursive idioms – \\\"Kaduna Mafia: the Killer Squad\\\", \\\"northern\\nminorities, why we fight them\\\", \\\"Hausa-Fulani violence\\\", and \\\"pastoral\\njihadism\\\", which featured regularly in both academic and popular discourse.\\nBetween 1980 and 2016 more than 100 violent communal clashes – in which\\nthousands of people including women and children lost their lives – were\\nreported in the volatile Middle Belt areas of Jos, Benue and Southern Kaduna.\\nTo what extent do these historical discourses function as\\nincentive to violent clashes? Located within critical work that is attuned to the salience of knowledge-conflict nexus, the project seeks to demonstrate how historical narratives, animated by rumours and conspiracy theories, acquired functional discursive properties and social meaning. Preliminary reading of the conflicts suggests deep-seated intersection between historiography, victimhood, vengeance and violence.\",\"award_title\":\"\",\"award_institution\":\"Bayero University Kano\",\"award_department\":\"Department of History\",\"image_url\":\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/ssrc-cdn1/crmuploads/contact/%7BC04E8D00-7DAE-E611-80C2-005056AB0BD9%7D.jpg\",\"related_competitions\":\"African Peacebuilding Network: Individual Research Fellowships\",\"fellow_topics\":\"\",\"authors\":null,\"primary_author\":null,\"publish_date\":null,\"publisher\":null,\"s3azure_image_url\":\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/ssrc-cdn1/crmuploads/contact/%7BC04E8D00-7DAE-E611-80C2-005056AB0BD9%7D.jpg\",\"s3azure_pdf_url\":null,\"type\":null,\"post_year\":2021,\"content\":\"Dr. Samaila Suleiman is a lecturer in History at Bayero University, Kano.

All countries face major challenges to ensure preparedness in health and social systems. Japan is the most advanced aging society in the world (28 % of the aging rate), with great pressure on national finance, e.g., an increase of $6.6 million primarily targeting the older population for the 2019 budget. Japan is shifting from a hospital-base to home-base health care delivery to prepare for an estimated 1.6 million deaths/yr. from 2035. Such rapid demographic change threatens individuals, communities, society, and the country. The US (15 % of aging rate) will have 78 million people aged over 65, exceeding the number of children. Hospices (over 6,100) outnumbered hospitals (5,723). Medicare Part A covers end-of-life care is estimated to be depleted by 2030. \\n\\nWhat is Unknown: Justice in end-of-life is little studied in general. The end-of-life care experts' experiences with dying patients were not well aggregated. \\n\\nPurpose of the Research: I will examine how justice (through a bioethics and human rights-based approach) may improve 'quality of life' and 'quality of death/dying' in end-of-life care by exploring achievements and challenges from a view of public policy. \\n\\nResearch Questions: (a) How do bioethics, human rights, and evidence-based medicine effect end-of-life care? (b) What are the situations of the quality of life and the quality of death/dying in end-of-life care? (c) How does the WHO's definition of 'health' fit to the changing demographics/societies? (d) What are the implications for improving 'quality of life' and the 'quality of death/dying' in end-of-life care in the aging societies? \\n\\nMethods: (a) Qualitative research, a powerful instrument for little studied subjects, will be the central analytical methodology for this proposed research. For data collection, analysis, and developing a theory, I will employ grounded theory, established by scholars who studied processes and situations of death/dying, which is used in health care fields. I will target interviews with one hundred end-of-life experts in the primary countries (Japan and the US) and other related countries (the UK and South Korea). I will perform open coding, axial coding, and theoretical coding. Theoretical sampling will be performed to judge a theoretical saturation (where no more new codes are being formed). NVivo will be used as a supporting instrument. (b) Quantitative research (typology and taxonomy methods) on quantifiable data will be used to fortify the analysis and interpretation of the qualitative research. (c) Content analysis will also be performed by qualitative and/or quantitative methodologies by contrasting my research contents.\\n\\nThe Value of the Research: A part of the proposed project will be conducted while serving as a coauthor of the Lancet Commission (2018-2019 scheduled). A synthesis of my analysis on end-of-life care, focusing on better life and a better death (with the Abe Fellowship Program and with the Lancet international project) will address the global threats of social and fiscal sustainability in aging societies. It will also showcase the important elements of interdisciplinary team-approaches, community/regional collaborations, and multi-sector partnerships.\",\"award_title\":\"Visiting Researcher\",\"award_institution\":\"Georgetown University\",\"award_department\":\"Kennedy Institute of  Ethics\",\"image_url\":\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/ssrc-cdn1/crmuploads/contact/sase-eriko.jpg\",\"related_competitions\":\"Abe Fellowship\",\"fellow_topics\":\"\",\"authors\":null,\"primary_author\":null,\"publish_date\":null,\"publisher\":null,\"s3azure_image_url\":\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/ssrc-cdn1/crmuploads/contact/sase-eriko.jpg\",\"s3azure_pdf_url\":null,\"type\":null,\"post_year\":2018,\"content\":\"Eriko Sase is an award winning scholar in Health Science.

Their everyday living experiences and narratives are symptomatic of life devoid of security, characteristically gendered and seemingly constrained in terms of social and physical space and practices.

My study seeks to explore this epistemological trajectory through the use of novel techniques of analysis in the form of a discursive-materialist analysis of the human-object entanglement, where landmines as objects possess a coercive effect in reconfiguring the everyday experiences and security of the people in Mukumbura in a post-conflict context. This dimension inclines to the Posthumanism or new materialities perspective which engender the object as unit of analysis/actor in human security and peace discourse in post-conflict contexts relative to the traditional realist notion of security-insecurity as a function of humans alone.

However, most\\nstudies of conflict in the region have only focused on social, economic,\\npolitical, religious and environmental factors, ignoring salient\\nhistoriographical/textual and discursive roots and processes of the\\nphenomenon. This project interrogates how\\nthe extra-textual meaning-assigning agency of historiography is\\nmanufactured and weaponized in conflict situations. As monster-making\\ntechnology, these narratives originally popularized by journalists gradually\\nsneaked into the academia, creating a dissident community of discourse –\\nacademic authors, activists, priests and publishers who together constructed\\na popular cultural resentment against the Hausa-Fulani Muslims. The\\nconsumers of these narratives are constantly reminded of the historical\\ninjuries of the 19th jihad wars in Hausa land and mobilized along the most\\ndreaded discursive idioms – \\\"Kaduna Mafia: the Killer Squad\\\", \\\"northern\\nminorities, why we fight them\\\", \\\"Hausa-Fulani violence\\\", and \\\"pastoral\\njihadism\\\", which featured regularly in both academic and popular discourse.\\nBetween 1980 and 2016 more than 100 violent communal clashes – in which\\nthousands of people including women and children lost their lives – were\\nreported in the volatile Middle Belt areas of Jos, Benue and Southern Kaduna.\\nTo what extent do these historical discourses function as\\nincentive to violent clashes? Located within critical work that is attuned to the salience of knowledge-conflict nexus, the project seeks to demonstrate how historical narratives, animated by rumours and conspiracy theories, acquired functional discursive properties and social meaning. Preliminary reading of the conflicts suggests deep-seated intersection between historiography, victimhood, vengeance and violence.\",\"award_title\":\"\",\"award_institution\":\"Bayero University Kano\",\"award_department\":\"Department of History\",\"image_url\":\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/ssrc-cdn1/crmuploads/contact/%7BC04E8D00-7DAE-E611-80C2-005056AB0BD9%7D.jpg\",\"related_competitions\":\"African Peacebuilding Network: Individual Research Fellowships\",\"fellow_topics\":\"\",\"authors\":null,\"primary_author\":null,\"publish_date\":null,\"publisher\":null,\"s3azure_image_url\":\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/ssrc-cdn1/crmuploads/contact/%7BC04E8D00-7DAE-E611-80C2-005056AB0BD9%7D.jpg\",\"s3azure_pdf_url\":null,\"type\":null,\"post_year\":2021,\"content\":\"Dr. Samaila Suleiman is a lecturer in History at Bayero University, Kano.

All countries face major challenges to ensure preparedness in health and social systems. Japan is the most advanced aging society in the world (28 % of the aging rate), with great pressure on national finance, e.g., an increase of $6.6 million primarily targeting the older population for the 2019 budget. Japan is shifting from a hospital-base to home-base health care delivery to prepare for an estimated 1.6 million deaths/yr. from 2035. Such rapid demographic change threatens individuals, communities, society, and the country. The US (15 % of aging rate) will have 78 million people aged over 65, exceeding the number of children. Hospices (over 6,100) outnumbered hospitals (5,723). Medicare Part A covers end-of-life care is estimated to be depleted by 2030. \\n\\nWhat is Unknown: Justice in end-of-life is little studied in general. The end-of-life care experts' experiences with dying patients were not well aggregated. \\n\\nPurpose of the Research: I will examine how justice (through a bioethics and human rights-based approach) may improve 'quality of life' and 'quality of death/dying' in end-of-life care by exploring achievements and challenges from a view of public policy. \\n\\nResearch Questions: (a) How do bioethics, human rights, and evidence-based medicine effect end-of-life care? (b) What are the situations of the quality of life and the quality of death/dying in end-of-life care? (c) How does the WHO's definition of 'health' fit to the changing demographics/societies? (d) What are the implications for improving 'quality of life' and the 'quality of death/dying' in end-of-life care in the aging societies? \\n\\nMethods: (a) Qualitative research, a powerful instrument for little studied subjects, will be the central analytical methodology for this proposed research. For data collection, analysis, and developing a theory, I will employ grounded theory, established by scholars who studied processes and situations of death/dying, which is used in health care fields. I will target interviews with one hundred end-of-life experts in the primary countries (Japan and the US) and other related countries (the UK and South Korea). I will perform open coding, axial coding, and theoretical coding. Theoretical sampling will be performed to judge a theoretical saturation (where no more new codes are being formed). NVivo will be used as a supporting instrument. (b) Quantitative research (typology and taxonomy methods) on quantifiable data will be used to fortify the analysis and interpretation of the qualitative research. (c) Content analysis will also be performed by qualitative and/or quantitative methodologies by contrasting my research contents.\\n\\nThe Value of the Research: A part of the proposed project will be conducted while serving as a coauthor of the Lancet Commission (2018-2019 scheduled). A synthesis of my analysis on end-of-life care, focusing on better life and a better death (with the Abe Fellowship Program and with the Lancet international project) will address the global threats of social and fiscal sustainability in aging societies. It will also showcase the important elements of interdisciplinary team-approaches, community/regional collaborations, and multi-sector partnerships.\",\"award_title\":\"Visiting Researcher\",\"award_institution\":\"Georgetown University\",\"award_department\":\"Kennedy Institute of  Ethics\",\"image_url\":\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/ssrc-cdn1/crmuploads/contact/sase-eriko.jpg\",\"related_competitions\":\"Abe Fellowship\",\"fellow_topics\":\"\",\"authors\":null,\"primary_author\":null,\"publish_date\":null,\"publisher\":null,\"s3azure_image_url\":\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/ssrc-cdn1/crmuploads/contact/sase-eriko.jpg\",\"s3azure_pdf_url\":null,\"type\":null,\"post_year\":2018,\"content\":\"Eriko Sase is an award winning scholar in Health Science.
